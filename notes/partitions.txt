We'd like to have:
# ESP32 Partition Table
# nvs: 20KB - Non-volatile storage
# otadata: 8KB - OTA data partition  
# app0: 2.5MB - Primary application partition
# app1: 2.5MB - Secondary application partition (OTA)
# coredump: 64KB - Core dump storage
# spiffs: 10MB - File system storage
# phy_init: 4K - Improved WiFi performance

When changing partitions.csv:
	1. pio run --target clean (takes care of local, and prod)
	2. pio run --target erase (takes care of local, and prod)
	3. Upload and monitor (will need to re-upload filesystem and code)
