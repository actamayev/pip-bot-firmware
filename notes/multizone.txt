# VL53L7CX Sensor Parameters Guide

## SIGNAL_THRESHOLD
• Controls the minimum signal quality required for a reading to be considered valid.
• Increasing: Makes filtering more strict, rejecting more readings with poor signal quality. Improves reliability but reduces sensitivity.
• Decreasing: Makes sensor more sensitive to weak signals, better for detecting small or distant objects, but may introduce more noise.

## MIN_VALID_POINTS
• Minimum number of valid data points needed to confirm an obstacle is present.
• Increasing: Improves confidence in obstacle detection, reduces false positives, but may miss small objects.
• Decreasing: Makes detection more sensitive to small objects, but may increase false positives.

## OBSTACLE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD
• Maximum distance (in mm) at which an object is considered an obstacle.
• Increasing: Detects obstacles at greater distances, providing more time to react.
• Decreasing: Focuses only on closer obstacles, reducing false positives from distant objects.

## sharpener_percent
• Controls the strength of the edge sharpening algorithm (0-99%).
• Increasing: Creates sharper edges between objects, prevents one object from appearing in multiple zones, but may cause small targets to be missed.
• Decreasing: Makes sensor more likely to detect diffuse or small objects, but objects may appear larger/spread across more zones than they really are.

## xtalk_margin
• Filters out noise from reflections within the sensor's cover glass.
• Increasing: Improves immunity to internal reflections/noise, especially with a cover glass, but reduces sensitivity.
• Decreasing: Improves sensitivity but may introduce more false readings from internal reflections.

## integrationTimeMs
• Duration the sensor actively collects photons during each measurement.
• Increasing: Improves signal quality and maximum range, but increases power consumption and slightly reduces measurement rate.
• Decreasing: Reduces power consumption, but may reduce maximum range and signal quality.

## maxDistance
• Maximum distance (in mm) at which readings are considered valid.
• Increasing: Allows detection of more distant objects, but may introduce more noise at the extremes of range.
• Decreasing: Focuses system on closer objects, potentially improving reliability by ignoring uncertain distant readings.

## minDistance
• Minimum distance (in mm) at which readings are considered valid.
• Increasing: Helps filter out very close phantom readings, but may ignore very close real objects.
• Decreasing: Allows detection of very close objects, but may introduce more phantom readings.

## ranging_frequency
• How many measurements the sensor takes per second (Hz).
• Increasing: Provides more frequent updates for faster-moving objects/robots, but increases power consumption.
• Decreasing: Reduces power consumption, but updates less frequently which may miss fast-moving objects.

## TARGET_STATUS_VALID Thresholds
• Defines confidence levels for different status values returned by the sensor.
• **Using stricter status filters**: Improves reliability by only accepting high-confidence measurements, but may reduce detection sensitivity.
• **Using looser status filters**: Improves sensitivity by accepting lower-confidence measurements, but may introduce more errors.
