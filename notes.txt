To create a sound file:
	1. Find a song you want.
	2. Convert to MP3
	3. Place in the /data folder (should be in project root)
	4. To upload to ESP, go to Upload Filesystem Image (under Platform in the PlatformIO extension)
		This uploads the raw data
	5. Then, upload the code normally (Upload and Monitor)
